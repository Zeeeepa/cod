# Fixed Slack Bot for Codegen

This solution fixes the issue where the Slack bot is not responding to messages despite the Slack integration working correctly (as evidenced by the "Bot Started Successfully!" message).

## The Problem

The main issue was that Slack was sending events to the root URL (`/`) instead of the `/slack/events` endpoint, but the application wasn't properly handling these events at the root level. Additionally, there were issues with how the events were being processed and how responses were being sent back to Slack.

## Key Features of the Fix

- **Root URL Event Handling**: Properly handles all Slack events sent to the root URL (`/`)
- **Manual Event Processing**: Directly processes Slack events without relying on the standard handler
- **Detailed Logging**: Logs the raw request body for better debugging
- **Bot ID Detection**: Automatically detects the bot's user ID to avoid infinite loops
- **Robust Error Handling**: Ensures responses are always sent, even when errors occur
- **Startup Notification**: Sends a notification when the bot starts up

## How to Use

1. Copy the `.env.template` file to `.env` and fill in your credentials:
   ```
   # Slack Configuration
   SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET="your_slack_signing_secret"
   SLACK_BOT_TOKEN="xoxb-your-slack-bot-token"
   SLACK_NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL="your_slack_channel_id"
   
   # GitHub Configuration
   GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_personal_access_token"
   
   # Anthropic API Key (optional)
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_anthropic_api_key"
   ```

2. Run the fixed application:
   ```bash
   python fixed_slack_events.py
   ```

3. Use ngrok to expose your local server:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 8000
   ```

4. Configure your Slack app's Event Subscriptions URL with the **root URL** from ngrok:
   ```
   https://your-ngrok-url/
   ```
   
   **IMPORTANT**: Use the root URL, not `/slack/events`

## How It Works

The fixed application includes several key improvements:

1. **Direct Event Handling**: The root endpoint (`/`) now directly handles Slack events instead of relying on the standard handler
2. **Raw Request Logging**: The application logs the raw request body for better debugging
3. **Manual Event Processing**: Events are processed manually with dedicated handlers for app mentions and direct messages
4. **Bot ID Detection**: The application automatically detects the bot's user ID to avoid infinite loops
5. **Robust Error Handling**: All exceptions are caught and logged, ensuring responses are always sent

## Troubleshooting

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. **Check the Logs**: Look for any error messages in the logs
2. **Verify Slack Configuration**: Make sure your Slack app is configured correctly
3. **Check Bot Token**: Ensure your `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` is correct
4. **Verify Event Subscription URL**: Make sure you're using the root URL (`/`) for the Event Subscription URL
5. **Check Bot Permissions**: Ensure the bot has the necessary permissions in Slack
